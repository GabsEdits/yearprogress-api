<h1>Year's Progress API</h1>
<p>A simple API to get the progress of the year</p>
</div>

---

## Usage

You can get the progress of the year by sending a `GET` request to the following endpoint:

```
https://years-progress-api.vercel.app/api/progress
```

The response will be a JSON object with the following properties:

```json
{
  "progress": "82.19%",
  "days": 300,
  "remaining": "17.81%"
}
```

- `progress`: The progress of the year as a decimal number.
- `days`: The number of days that have passed in the year.
- `remaining`: The number of days left in the year.

## Why?

I created this API in the 300th day of the year to celebrate the progress of the year, and it reminded me of how fast time flies. I hope you find it interesting and maybe even useful!
